He assumed office in 2014 and was re-elected in 2019.  The PM is appointed by the President, but commands a majority in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).  The PM's office (PMO) manages the executive branch.  Key responsibilities include setting national policy, leading cabinet meetings, and representing India internationally.  The PM also chairs the National Development Council, guiding national planning.  The position is powerful, influencing economic, social, and foreign policy. Modi's tenure has seen initiatives like \"Make in India\" and \"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.\"  His government faces various challenges, including economic inequality and social divisions.  The office is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and media attention.  The PM's role is vital for maintaining political stability and national development.  Succession planning is a significant factor, impacting future government stability. The PM's actions significantly influence public opinion and global perceptions of India.  The office holds considerable symbolic power as well as real political authority.  Elections every five years determine the PM and the ruling party.  The PM works closely with various government ministries and departments. The office's effectiveness impacts the lives of over a billion Indians.

      "Newton's Third Law of Motion simply states: **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object.  These forces are called action and reaction forces.  It's crucial to understand that these forces act on *different* objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's illustrate with some everyday examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Walking:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** You push backward on the ground with your feet (this is the action force).\n",
      "* **Reaction:** The ground pushes forward on your feet with an equal and opposite force (this is the reaction force).  This forward push is what propels you forward.  If the ground didn't push back, you'd just slide your feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like trying to walk on very smooth ice – the ice doesn't push back effectively, so you slip.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  Swimming:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:**  A swimmer pushes backward on the water with their hands and feet.\n",
      "* **Reaction:** The water pushes forward on the swimmer's hands and feet. This forward push moves the swimmer through the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.  Rocket Launch:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** The rocket expels hot gases downward (this is the action force).\n",
      "* **Reaction:** The gases exert an equal and opposite upward force on the rocket (this is the reaction force), propelling it upwards.  This is often described as the \"exhaust pushing against the ground\" – that's technically not perfectly true, it is the exhaust pushing on itself, which then causes a reaction force.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.  Jumping:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** You push down on the Earth with your legs (this is the action force).\n",
      "* **Reaction:** The Earth pushes up on you with an equal and opposite force (this is the reaction force). This upward force launches you into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** The action and reaction forces are always the *same type* of force.  If you push on a wall (a contact force), the wall pushes back on you (also a contact force).  If you are pulled down by gravity, the Earth's gravity is affected by the pull from you - so it feels that opposite force (though the effect is minute because the Earth is so massive).\n",
      "\n",
      "The key takeaway is that forces always come in pairs, and these pairs act on *different* objects.  They don't cancel each other out because they are acting on different things, causing a change in motion.  If they were acting on the same object, they *would* cancel out and there would be no movement.\n",

      "Logistic regression might sound intimidating, but at its core, it's a surprisingly intuitive method for predicting the probability of something happening.  Imagine you're trying to predict whether a customer will click on an ad (yes/no), whether an email is spam (yes/no), or if a loan applicant will default (yes/no).  Logistic regression is perfectly suited for these kinds of \"binary classification\" problems.\n",

      "\n",
      "The odds themselves aren't linearly related to the input variables (like age, income, etc.).  That's where the \"logit\" function comes in. It transforms the odds into a linear scale. The logit function is simply the natural logarithm of the odds:\n",
      "\n",
      "`logit(p) = ln(p / (1 - p))`\n",
      "\n",
      "where 'p' is the probability of the event happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "This transformation allows us to model the relationship between the input variables and the probability using a simple linear equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "`logit(p) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ`\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `β₀` is the intercept (the log-odds when all input variables are zero).\n",
      "* `β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ` are the coefficients representing the effect of each input variable (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) on the log-odds.  A positive coefficient means an increase in that variable increases the log-odds (and thus the probability), and vice-versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: The Sigmoid Function – Getting Back to Probabilities**\n",
      "\n",
      "The linear equation gives us the log-odds. To get back to the probability, we use the inverse of the logit function, which is the sigmoid function:\n",
      "\n",
      "`p = 1 / (1 + exp(-(β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ)))`\n",
      "\n",
      "The sigmoid function squashes the linear output between 0 and 1, representing a probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 4: Estimating the Coefficients (β's)**\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of logistic regression is finding the best values for the coefficients (β's). This is done using a process called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).  MLE aims to find the coefficients that maximize the likelihood of observing the actual data.  This is a complex optimization problem usually solved using iterative algorithms like gradient descent.  (The exact details of MLE and gradient descent are quite advanced and might be better suited for a separate, more technical blog post).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Predicting Email Spam**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say we want to predict if an email is spam based on the length of the email (x₁) and the number of exclamation marks (x₂). We might have a model like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "`logit(p) = -2 + 0.01x₁ + 0.5x₂`\n",
      "\n",
      "If an email has 100 words (x₁ = 100) and 3 exclamation marks (x₂ = 3):\n",
      "\n",
      "`logit(p) = -2 + 0.01(100) + 0.5(3) = 0.5`\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying the sigmoid function:\n",
      "\n",
      "`p = 1 / (1 + exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.62`\n",
      "\n",
      "The model predicts a 62% probability that the email is spam.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 5: Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
      "\n",
      "After building the model, we need to evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve).  This helps us understand how well the model is generalizing to unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Logistic regression has some hyperparameters, although fewer than many other machine learning models.  The most important is often the regularization parameter (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization).  Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.  We tune these hyperparameters by trying different values and selecting the one that yields the best performance on a validation set (a separate dataset used for tuning).  This process is crucial for finding the optimal balance between model complexity and generalization ability.  Techniques like grid search or cross-validation are commonly used for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Logistic regression, while mathematically grounded, is a powerful and relatively simple tool for binary classification problems. Understanding its core principles – odds, logit, sigmoid, and the coefficient estimation process – allows you to interpret the model's results and build effective predictive models. Remember that proper evaluation and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for ensuring your model performs reliably in real-world applications.\n",

      "Linear regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used statistical and machine learning techniques.  It's a supervised learning algorithm (meaning it learns from labeled data) used to predict a *continuous* outcome variable (also called the dependent variable or target) based on one or more predictor variables (also called independent variables or features). The core idea is to find the *best-fitting straight line* (in simple linear regression) or plane/hyperplane (in multiple linear regression) that describes the relationship between the variables.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. The Relationship:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Linear regression assumes a *linear* relationship between the predictor(s) and the outcome. This means that as the predictor variable(s) change, the outcome variable changes in a roughly constant, proportional way.  It *doesn't* mean the data must perfectly fall on a straight line, but rather that a straight line is a reasonable approximation of the trend.  Non-linear relationships can sometimes be modeled with linear regression by transforming the variables (e.g., using logarithms, squares, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Simple Linear Regression (One Predictor):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Equation:** The relationship is described by the equation of a straight line:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    y = β₀ + β₁x + ε\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   `y`:  The outcome variable (what you're trying to predict).\n",
      "    *   `x`: The predictor variable (what you're using to make the prediction).\n",
      "    *   `β₀`: The y-intercept (the value of `y` when `x` is 0). This is a constant term.\n",
      "    *   `β₁`: The slope (the change in `y` for a one-unit change in `x`).  This represents the strength and direction of the relationship.  A positive slope means `y` increases as `x` increases.  A negative slope means `y` decreases as `x` increases.\n",
      "    *   `ε`: The error term (also called the residual). This represents the difference between the actual value of `y` and the predicted value of `y` from the line.  It accounts for the fact that the line won't perfectly fit all the data points.  We assume these errors are randomly distributed.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example:**  Predicting house price (`y`) based on square footage (`x`).  A larger square footage would likely lead to a higher price, and this relationship might be reasonably approximated by a straight line.\n",

      "*   **Example:**  Predicting house price (`y`) based on square footage (`x₁`), number of bedrooms (`x₂`), and distance to the city center (`x₃`).  Each of these factors could influence the price, and multiple linear regression allows us to model their combined effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Finding the Best-Fitting Line (or Plane/Hyperplane):**\n",

A \"funnel\" shape suggests heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance).\n",
      "*   **Normality of Errors:**  The errors should be approximately normally distributed.  This is important for hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations.  You can check this with a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals.\n",
      "*   **No or Little Multicollinearity (for Multiple Regression):**  The predictor variables should not be highly correlated with each other.  High multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor and can lead to unstable coefficient estimates.  Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a common metric to assess multicollinearity.\n",

      "*   **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):**  R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the outcome variable that is explained by the predictor variables.  It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.  An R-squared of 0.75 means that 75% of the variation in the outcome is explained by the model. *However, a high R-squared does not guarantee a good model.* You must still check for assumption violations.\n",
      "*   **Adjusted R-squared:**  A modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors in the model.  It penalizes models with too many predictors that don't significantly improve the fit.\n",
      "*   **p-values:**  Used for hypothesis testing.  A p-value associated with a coefficient tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (i.e., that the predictor has no effect on the outcome).  A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the predictor is statistically significant.\n",
      "*   **Confidence Intervals:** Provide a range of plausible values for the coefficients.\n",
